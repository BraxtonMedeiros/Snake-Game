# Overview

I decided to write a Snake game program. This game is an oldie! I remember playing it as a kid and it was so much fun! I wanted to remkae it while learning how to use Java. I have a passion for gaming so being able to recreate it myself was such a cool experience!

I followed along with a Youtube video I found. The way he explained it helped me learn how Java works! I was able to implement my own functions in this program. For example, his program just generated apples randomly. That's what we want but I realized the problem with that is sometimes it would generate an apple that would be under a part of the snakes body. So I implemented what I learned and figured out how to have the apple be generated in a random spot in the free spaces so it doesn't overlap with the snake.

# Development Environment

The editor I used was IntelliJ

I used Java to accomplish my task! I used some built in libraries to help me with that. I had to import them like so
import javax.swing.*; 
import java.awt.*;
import java.awt.event.*;
import java.io.*;
import java.util.Random;
import java.util.Arrays;

# Future Work

- Give the option for the user to pick the color of snake they would like
